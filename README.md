### **Description**

This C# code is a console application that interfaces with a magnetic stripe reader (MSR) device using the OPOS (OLE for Retail POS) standard. The program uses the AxOPOSMSR ActiveX control to communicate with the MSR device (specifically, "NCRMSR.0" is assumed to represent an MSR manufactured by NCR).



The C++ code is a wrapper for managing the MSR device through an external executable using a custom binary data exchange format stored in the file (oposmsr_ocx_data.bin).
